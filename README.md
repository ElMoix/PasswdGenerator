# PasswdGenerator

## Python3 script used to generate a strong random password.

## The script uses the python3 libraries **'random'** and **'string'.**

### Example:
```
andreu@kali:~/PasswdGenerator$ python3 strongpasswd.py 
Password length: 8 
Your password is:
WK0nD4s7
```

### Trick
In the script there is a variable called 'components'.
You can comment one and uncomment the other to have a stronger password (the second one uses special characters).
